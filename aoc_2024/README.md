# Advent of Code 2024 - Rust Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

I'm solving this year's challenges using **Rust** as a way to learn and improve my skills in the language. Since I'm still in the process of learning Rust, the code might not always be the cleanest or most optimal solution, but I'm having fun and learning along the way! ðŸ˜„

## Goals
- Complete as many days as possible in **Advent of Code 2024**.
- Learn **Rust** by applying it to real-world problems.
- Gradually improve my coding and problem-solving skills.

## Running the Code
To run a specific day's solution:
```bash
cargo run dayXX
```

To run the tests for a specific day's solution:
```bash
cargo test puzzles::dayXX::test -- --nocapture
```
